The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program
using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX
projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

### Bonus part:
- The server confirms every signal received by sending a signal to the client
- Unicode characters support (not really, lol)
